Welcome to my 'work-in-progress' professional portfolio! 
The purpose of this particular repository is to practice utilizing Bootstrap code. I used Bulma for this project as I wanted to use the code that was geared more towards columns, which I found Bulma was a good start.
As of right now, my portfolio consists of a simple design showcasing my name boldly. I provided a profile picture as well as an updated view of the projects I have been working on for the duration of my coding Bootcamp course.
I included working links to my Instgram, LinkedIn, and Github. Although everything is still a work in progress, I will continue to add more projects as I strengthen my skills.
